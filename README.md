### Project Description
[This tool is designed to help users listen to their documents, making it useful for students, professionals, and individuals with visual impairments.]

### The Problem statement
[To make the PDF content clearer, we have decided to develop a website that converts PDFs into voice notes, summaries, and potential questions.]

### The Solution
[To save everyone from the headache of vague PDFs, we‚Äôre building a website that transforms them into voice notes, bite-sized summaries, and possible quiz questions‚Äîbecause who has time to decode PDFs like ancient scrolls?]
